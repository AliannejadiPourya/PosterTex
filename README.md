##  **Why PosterTeX**

Researchers often struggle to translate dense academic papers into clear, visually appealing posters. PosterTeX:

- Provides a logical layout tailored to common research-paper elements.
- Enforces a consistent, easy-to-read design across sections.
- Is based on a battle-tested Beamer theme and fully compatible with Overleaf or local TeX installations.

---

##  **Features**

- Seven built-in sections covering everything from your research gap to future work.
- Two figure slots with captions ready to showcase key diagrams.
- University logo support and title blocks you can easily swap out.
- Custom color palette and font choices consistent with academic posters.
- Minimal dependencies—nothing beyond standard LaTeX/Beamer packages.

---

## **Installation**

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PosterTeX.git
```

Install any missing LaTeX packages (e.g., beamer, tikz, graphicx).
Open `poster.tex` in your editor or Overleaf.

---

##  **Quick Start**

1. Copy `poster.tex` (or `poster-example.tex`) to your working folder.
2. Replace the title, authors, and institution:

```latex
\title{Your Poster Title}
\author{Alice Smith \and Bob Jones}
\institute{University of Example}
```

3. Swap out `Logo-Right.png` for your own logo.
4. Edit each section in the template (see “Section Guide” below).
5. Compile with:

```bash
lualatex poster.tex
```

## **Section Guide**

PosterTeX divides your poster into seven core panels—each panel maps to a familiar part of your research paper:

**Research Gap**
> Introduces the problem space and identifies what’s missing in the literature. Sets the stage by highlighting why your work matters.

**Main Contributions**
> A concise bullet list of your paper’s key innovations or discoveries. Quickly communicates your “so what.”

**Method Overview**
> Sketch out your proposed approach, experimental setup, or theoretical model. Often includes a simple diagram or flowchart.

**Key Findings**
> Summarize the most important results or data points. Focus on high-impact takeaways.

**Strengths & Weaknesses**
> An honest self-assessment. Shows reviewers you understand your method’s limitations and advantages.

**Future Directions**
> Propose extensions, open questions, or applications for follow-up work. Invites discussion and collaboration.

**Core Equation**
> Display your central mathematical expression or model derivation. Helps technically minded viewers grasp the formal underpinnings at a glance.

## **Figures & Graphics**

PosterTeX reserves two figure slots—just drop your images into `graphics/` and reference them in `poster.tex`:

```latex
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{your-figure1.png}
  \caption{An overview of our three RAG modes.}
\end{figure}
```

- **Figure 1:** Illustrate your workflow or architecture.
- **Figure 2:** Show sample results, data visualizations, or example layouts.

---

## **Customization**

PosterTeX is designed for easy branding:

- **Logo:** Replace `logos/Logo-Right.png` with your institution’s emblem.
- **Colors:** Tweak `beamerthemePoster.sty` to adjust primary and accent colors.
- **Fonts:** Change `\setmainfont{…}` or standard LaTeX font commands in `poster.tex`.
